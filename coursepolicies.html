<h2>Course Policies</h2>
<p><a href="com550syllabus.html">Back to syllabus</a></p>

<h3>School of Communications Professional Standards Policies</h3>
<p>The School of Communications has adopted the following minimum policies to provide students with a clear understanding and consistent application of course expectations, since journalism and communications are disciplines with rigorous professional standards. Teachers may designate more stringent policies on their course syllabi.</p>

<h4>Attendance Policy</h4>

<p>Students in the School of Communications are expected to attend all classes. Just as professionals go to work each day, we expect students in a professional school to come to class on time and be prepared to work.</p>

<p>A student who misses more than 20% of scheduled classes in a term (more than eight absences for classes meeting three times a week, more than five absences for classes meeting twice a week, more than three absences for classes meeting once a week) automatically receives an F because the student has missed too much content and participation to pass a course in a professional school.</p>

<p>Teachers will lower the final grade in a class for each absence beyond the equivalent of one week of class (three absences for classes meeting three times a week, two absences for classes meeting twice a week, and one absence during winter term, a summer session, or a once-a-week class during a regular semester) as indicated in the course syllabus. An exception may exist for a student who misses more than a week of classes for a sanctioned university activity, such as presenting research at a national forum, class travel or university athletic travel. Students participating in such events must submit a written request in advance to the professor.</p>

<p>Roll will be taken at the start of the class. A student who arrives late and did not participate in roll call will need to see the instructor at a break or at the end of class to assure that they have been marked tardy rather than absent. Three tardies convert to one absence.</p>

<h4>Coursework</h4>

<p>If students miss a class because of illness, participation in a university-sponsored activity, job interview or other causes, they have missed valuable content and engaged learning. In this sense, excused and unexcused absences are no different. To ensure that students avoid gaps in the progression of a course, professors may assign additional work. For example, a professor may require a student to write a 400-word summary of material covered in a missed class session or complete an additional lab assignment that demonstrates comprehension of material covered.</p>

<p>In this course, a student missing a class will be required to contact the instructor prior to the missed session via email to wjmoner@elon.edu with details on the student's plan to make up the material.</p>


<h4>Tests and Examinations</h4>

<p>If students miss a quiz, test or examination they must submit a written request for a makeup to the professor. Students who miss a final examination must secure permission for a makeup from the department chair. As indicated in the Elon University Faculty Handbook, "students are not guaranteed permission to make up examinations and have no guarantees about the impact of the absence on their final grade for the course."</p>

<h4>Grading system for the M.A. in Interactive Media program</h4>

<p>Graduation is dependent upon the quality of work and mastery of material in the 36 hours required to complete the Master of Arts in Interactive Media. Students will be evaluated using the following grade scale:</p>

<p>
H -	Honors<br>
P -	Pass with mastery<br>
L -	Low Pass<br>
F -	Fail
</p>

<p>If, in the judgment of the academic program director, faculty and the administrators of the School of Communications, a student fails to make satisfactory progress toward the completion of the degree or to demonstrate sufficient promise in the discipline, the student will not be allowed to continue in the interactive media master's program. Registration in the following semester for academically ineligible students will be cancelled automatically.</p>

<p>A student becomes academically ineligible to continue in the interactive media graduate program if s/he receives a grade of F, or 2 or more grades of L. The computation of hours taken will include courses for which the student has received a grade of H, P, L, or F.</p>

<h4>Assignments</h4>

<p>Professionals meet deadlines. All assignments should be submitted on time and are due in class on the assigned date even if the student is absent. You may receive one extension per semester on any assignment aside from the final project. An extension is defined as a one week time period in which to complete the work. Thus, if your work is due September 2, you have until September 9 to complete the work without penalty. Use your extension wisely.</p>

<h4>Elon Honor Code</h4>

<p>Elon's honor pledge calls for a commitment to Elon's shared values of Honesty, Integrity, Respect and Responsibility. To be clear about what constitutes violations of these values, students should be familiar with the Judicial Affairs policies in the student handbook, including violations outlined at <a href="http://www.elon.edu/e-web/students/handbook/violations/default.xhtml" target="_blank">http://www.elon.edu/e-web/students/handbook/violations/default.xhtml</a>.</p>

<p>Students with questions about the specific interpretation of these values and violations as they relate to this course should contact this instructor immediately. Violations in academic-related areas will be documented in an incident report which will be maintained in the Office of Student Conduct, and may result in a lowering of the course grade and/or failure of the course with an Honor Code F.</p>

<p>Violations specifically covered by academic honor code policies include: plagiarism, cheating, lying, stealing and the facilitation of another's dishonesty. Multiple violations will normally result in a student's temporary suspension from the University.</p>

<h4>Academic Honesty</h4>

<p>The School of Communications takes plagiarism seriously, just as businesses and other media organizations and scholars do.
</p><p>
All forms of dishonesty mentioned above may result in an F in a course and expulsion from the university. Although all of these are clear violations of the university Honor Code, plagiarism is a special concern for communications professionals and scholars.
</p><p>
What is plagiarism? It is using someone else's work such as passages, photographs, music, video, graphics and other images, and claiming it as your own. It can be copying work that has appeared in a journal, a magazine, a newspaper or online – anywhere, really – and presenting it as your own. Cutting and pasting passages from the Web into your work, for example, is plagiarism unless you credit the source of the material or images. Take this as your guiding principle: If you quote someone else's words or appropriate their image, attribute the source.
</p><p>
In brief, you may not adopt or reproduce the ideas, words or statements of another person without acknowledgment or attribution. In many cases, such work is copyrighted. 
</p><p>
Acknowledgment is required when borrowing facts, statistics, images or illustrative material, unless that information is common knowledge or in the public domain. (Example: China is the most populous nation on Earth. Or: Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system.)
</p><p>
If you quote someone else's words or use information or material acquired or created by someone else, then you must attribute the source. Definitions and examples of Elon Honor Code violations above may be found at <a href="http://www.elon.edu/e-web/students/handbook/" target="_blank">http://www.elon.edu/e-web/students/handbook/</a>.</p>

</p>

<h4>Religious Holidays Policies</h4>

<p>In supporting religious diversity, Elon has a policy and procedures for students who wish to observe religious holidays that are in conflict with the academic calendar, allowing students an excused absence.  Students who wish to observe a holiday during the semester must complete the online Religious Observance Notification Form (RONF), available at http://www.elon.edu/e-web/students/religious_life/ReligiousHolidays.xhtml, within the first two weeks of the semester. </p><p>
This policy does not apply during the final examination period. Students are required to make prior arrangements with the instructor for completion of any work missed during the absence. Once the completed RONF is received, the Truitt Center will confirm the excused absence with notification to the instructor and the appropriate academic dean, along with a copy to the student.  Students may contact the Truitt Center staff with any questions (336-278-7729).</p>

<h3>Student Options Related to Enrollment in this Course</h3>

<h4>Enrollment</h4>

<p>Students should confirm their enrollment in this course through their On-Track account.  Students who do not appear on the course roll or do not show the correct course/section listed on On-Track should consult with their instructor immediately.</p>

<h4>Policies on Dropping or Withdrawing from this Course</h4>

<p>Students may drop a course during the designated drop/add period through their On-Track account. A course that is dropped during the designated drop/add period will not appear on the student's transcript or grade report.</p><p>

After the designated drop/add period, students may withdraw from a course without penalty through the first half of the semester, following dates published in the academic calendar. Withdrawing from a course during this period will result in a mark of "W" that will appear on the student's academic transcript. Students may withdraw by using the online process located at http://www.elon.edu/e-web/administration/registrar/DropAddClassesOnline.xhtml
</p><p>
NOTE: Students should not assume that they will be officially withdrawn from a course based on their failing to attend class or their notifying a faculty member of their intent to withdraw. The student has the responsible for following the official process of withdrawing from a class. Students who do not properly withdraw from a course will receive a grade of F.
</p><p>
Students may not withdraw from a course after the published deadline. Any exception to this policy is the responsibility of the appropriate academic dean's office. When granted, withdrawal from a course after this time will result in a grade of "W" or "F" depending on the student's grade at the time.
</p><p>
